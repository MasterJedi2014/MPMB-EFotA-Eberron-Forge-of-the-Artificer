# MPMB-EFotA-Eberron-Forge-of-the-Artificer
This script adds the Artificer, its subclasses, the Dragonmark Feats, and the Species options from the 2024 "Eberron: Forge of the Artificer" book. There are 2 versions here, one for V13 of the MPMB sheet, which is intended to be used in conjunction with Poke's 2024 PHB &amp; DMG scripts, &amp; one for V14+ of the MPMB sheet.

## *THIS IS A WIP SCRIPT UNTIL AFTER THE BOOK ITSELF RELEASES*

**The "S13 V#" script is to be used in conjunction with the 5.24E scripts by ThePokésimmer. It will not work properly without those installed first. You can find those scripts here: https://github.com/thepokesimmer/2024-PHB/tree/main. The "S14+ V#" script is intended for use with MPMB sheets of version 14+ and do not need the 5.24E scripts by ThePokésimmer.**

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been compiled by MasterJedi2014, though the bones of the script are based on the code from MPMB and those who have contributed to the sheet's existing material in the "all_WotC_pub+UA" script. I am also using code within the script written by the users Shroo (S13 V# only), ThePokésimmer, & TrackAtNite. The only things in this script that I can currently take credit for are:
- Alterations made to address changes made by the UA;
- Converting the Homunculus Servant infusion into a spell, along with the needed `CompanionList` & `CreatureList` entries.
- The non-spell granting aspects of the Dragonmark Feats.

This script will allow users to play the revised Artificer & Eberron content. It also includes options to re-enable some aspects of the 2019/2020 Artificer that might be needed for an existing character to function.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2025-11-21:**
  - Initial upload of scripts (S13 V0.5 & S14+ V0.5).

**Known Bugs:**
- Will alter once bugs are found.
